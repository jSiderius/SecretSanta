# Project Title

This project is a secret santa application I made to use anually with friends and family. It randomly assigns names and emails each participant informing them which person they are buying for. The results are saved in output.txt for later reference if necessary.


## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Obtain a developer password for your email and/or allow third party access 

### Installation

1. Ensure all required python libraries are installed 
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
2. Add the names and emails of the participants to `main()` in `santa.py` as documented there 
3. Run the program 
```
python3 santa.py
```
4. Input your email address and developer password when prompted 
5. Enjoy!

## Built With
- python email & smtplib libraries
